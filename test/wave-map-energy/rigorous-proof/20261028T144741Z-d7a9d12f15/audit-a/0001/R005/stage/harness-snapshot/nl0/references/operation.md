# Installed skill operation

This reference is for the invoking agent/operator, not an additional proof step.
All executable paths are relative to the installed skill, independent of the
Yui repository. Keep case materials and outputs outside the installation.

## Request and configuration

The invoking agent identifies the explicit proof files and requested track:
`nl0` (NL0 + Audit A), `full`, `translate` (accepted NL0 onward), or `audit-b`
(existing native build, fresh semantic review only). Ask about genuinely ambiguous
scope; never add Lean work to an explicitly NL0-only request. Read only explicitly
provided files and relevant rules. A directory input selects its `problem.md`,
not all neighboring documents. Extra sources are explicit `--material` inputs.
Text/TeX/Markdown is copied exactly; PDF extraction uses `pdftotext -layout` or a disclosed pypdf fallback and
binds both original bytes and extracted text. An unreadable/scanned PDF needs an
explicitly checked text transcription before model execution.
The invoking agent checks that mathematical notation survives extraction before
freezing it as the supplied proof; a successful pdftotext exit is not a fidelity
judgment. Use an explicitly checked text source when the extraction is ambiguous.

Ask once for each missing active phase's model, reasoning effort and speed.
Retain choices supplied in the current request or already authorized in the
conversation. NL0 authors and Audit A share the NL0 profile. Source preparation,
local source review, interface authoring, all Lean proof jobs, assembly and Audit B
share the Lean profile. Do not ask about an unused phase. Do not invoke a separate
intent-classification model. Defaults in config.json require an explicit choice
(`--use-config-profiles`); installation defaults are not permission to bypass the
configuration question. The current isolated subscription carrier supports
Standard speed only. Unknown models/efforts/speeds are rejected explicitly;
model/effort availability is checked against local backend metadata and actual
transmitted/observed settings are recorded. No fallback or automatic upgrade.

Collect the following settings before preparing or dispatching a new run.
A phase profile means model, reasoning effort and speed:

| Requested track | Required user settings |
| --- | --- |
| NL0 and Audit A only (`nl0`) | NL0 phase profile and R-review worker count N |
| Accepted NL0/Audit A to Lean (`translate`) | Lean phase profile and per-case proof-worker count N |
| Complete workflow (`full`) | NL0 phase profile, Lean phase profile and per-case proof-worker count N |

Ask for all missing settings together. An explicitly supplied value, or an
explicit confirmation of a proposed value for this request, satisfies the
requirement; do not ask again. N must be a positive integer, including 1 when
the user wants serial proof work. Do not silently resolve an omitted count or
`auto` to two. If the user delegates the choice, propose a concrete N and obtain
confirmation before dispatch. Choosing `--use-config-profiles` does not choose
or confirm N. For several cases, explain that N applies to each case, then
retain a shared count unless different per-case settings were requested.

An `audit-b`-only continuation has no proof queue and needs only its Lean phase
profile, not N. `execute` and supported `resume` reuse an existing job's frozen
settings; they do not recollect values or change a historical worker count.
These configuration questions do not change the scheduling architecture:
The NL0 author, global Audit A, preparation, assembly and Audit B remain serial.
Local R reviews and later Lean proofs each use N independent slots, in separate phases.

## Entry commands

The user need not type commands or prepare intermediate files. After [resolving the target](target-selection.md) and collecting
configuration, the invoking agent calls the installed entry. For example:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py run /papers/example/proof.md \
  --track full \
  --nl0-model gpt-6.1-sol --nl0-effort high --nl0-speed standard \
  --lean-model gpt-6-luna --lean-effort high --lean-speed standard \
  --max-concurrency 5 --target-file /papers/example/target-selection.json --detach
```

Supply several problem paths to run independent cases together. For different
per-case sources, materials or profiles, `prepare` each separately, then use
`execute RUN_A RUN_B`. `prepare` makes no model/Lean calls. `--detach` starts
owned background case processes and returns their exact run paths; a parent
chat Stop is not a verified cancellation of these processes.

The invoking owner then follows [foreground handoff](owner-observation.md):
register one host heartbeat every ten minutes, save its actual ID and end the
foreground turn. Detached dispatch returns an explicit pending monitoring
handoff; it does not itself register a schedule. Do not wait through repeated
foreground sleeps or status polls.

For translation pass `--track translate --source /accepted/nl0-case`, the Lean
profile and the confirmed `--max-concurrency N`. For audit-only pass
`--track audit-b --audit /checked/native-audit-dir`.
An audit-only continuation discloses inherited native evidence and does not
claim a new proof, compilation or cold workflow result.

The public `run`/`prepare` entry requires `--max-concurrency N` for NL0, full and
translation tracks. It limits local R reviews and local Lean proof jobs per case
in separate phases, not all model stages. Low-level controllers retain `auto` for compatibility with existing
jobs; this is not a substitute for user confirmation at the public entry.
`--case-concurrency K` separately limits independent cases;
by default the explicitly requested cases may run concurrently. The author, global review, preparation, assembly and Audit B
remain serial within each case. Python controllers occupy no model slot.
Backend/account limits may lower observed concurrency; retain actual outcomes.

## Local output ownership

Default permanent output is `<problem-directory>/rigorous-proof/<run-id>/`:

```text
inputs/                  exact declared documents and extraction provenance
job.json                 immutable request, profiles, runtime/input bindings
.yui-run.json            cleanup ownership marker
execution-status.json    coalesced status/usage/owned-process record
nl0/0001/                first author; later numbers are actual local repairs
audit-a/0001/            corresponding independent actual assessments
nl0-to-lean/preparation/  bounded shared-source decision and any local reviews
nl0-to-lean/0001/         interface, workflow/proof-run, assembly, audit-b-review
audit-b/                 final-review index, or audit-only continuation evidence
repairs/                 actual located diagnostic routing
logs/                    controller lifecycle output
case-result.json         actual acceptance scope and execution qualification
```

Only applicable stages are created. Multiple attempts are retained, not
silently overwritten. An explicit `--output` chooses another new directory;
it cannot overwrite an input or write inside the skill. Never create a global
repository results directory, scan parent folders for proof caches or read other
cases. OS temporary sandboxes are registered and cleaned on stage exit; they
are not persistent scientific output. Running several cases adds no files to
their common parent or the example root. Batch summaries are per-run metadata,
never worker-visible mathematical inputs.

## Completion and repair

Ordinary `normal` policy organizes authoring, actual Audit A, optional bounded
factoring, interface freeze, the existing proof queue, actual standalone assembly,
native inspection and fresh semantic Audit B. It never turns a type/schema check
into a mathematical PASS. Unchanged valid Audit A is checked and reused rather
than repeated. A factoring no-op is normal. The existing narrow delta route
leaves consumers with accepted background notes unchanged; it never drops notes
or bypasses their scoped-review requirement to extract a lemma.

Return located ordinary A defects to the author with the prior draft; preserve
unaffected material and inherit only exact qualified passing review scopes.
Recheck graph structure. Do not send old judgments to independent new reviewers.
A real B endpoint defect returns to interface/implementation work, preserving the
accepted source. Revised interfaces and dependent proofs must pass their gates
again. Native implementation feedback remains inside its current author/proof
stage. A revised target/hypothesis requires the source boundary, never a hidden
change to the accepted task. Supported mathematical obstacles, unresolved source
access/disagreement and execution faults remain visible. Do not resample an
unchanged rejected artifact/review until PASS. Execution has no imposed time,
token or call quota unless the user explicitly requests one.

Explicit `first-pass` policy stops on the first actual nonpass for measurement;
it is not the default user workflow. Developer reviewer calibration is separate
from a case's mathematical review. Calibration tests live in tests/tooling and
do not supply missing mathematical judgments or force every ordinary paper to
run a development exercise campaign first. Calibration status, when measured,
is reported separately; it is not fabricated as a prerequisite receipt.

## Recoverable controller faults

Normal policy repairs ordinary mathematical feedback in its assigned author or
proof stage; an Audit A/B nonpass is not by itself a first-pass stop. Classify
execution failures separately. A verified bookkeeping defect must not force
the proof and all completed independent reviews to be repeated.

Inherited evidence is checked before any remaining review model is called.
If a legacy path-to-key index is wrong but the original judgment and matching
source bytes are intact and hash-bound, collection reconstructs a new index,
validates it with the unchanged full checks, and proceeds. It records the old
and new bindings in bookkeeping-repairs.json. This operation changes no theorem,
judgment, source content or acceptance rule and makes no model/native calls.
Missing/tampered evidence, changed context, unqualified execution or a nonpassing
judgment cannot be repaired into a PASS by this route.

After repairing this known defect in an already stopped run, use
`yui.py resume OLD_RUN --repair-evidence --detach`. The guarded entry requires
the recorded index error to be reproducible and all required actual reviews
to be complete and qualified. It restores the unchanged released source through
its bound lineage and inherits completed scopes instead of asking models again.
An unknown program defect preserves the current phase/artifact checkpoint and
requires a verified software fix; it is not a mathematical rejection, permission
to rewrite proof rules, or a reason to replay the whole problem from scratch.

## Remote-service recovery

The common model carrier retries positively identified temporary remote errors
(capacity, service availability, transient rate limiting or connection failures)
inside the same isolated thread. It retains actual drafts, source probes and
immutable tool receipts and uses the stage's existing short continuation input.
It does not repeat the initial task or execute a repeated completed tool-call ID
twice. The selected model, reasoning effort, speed, inputs and acceptance gates
remain fixed. A mathematical nonpass continues through normal located repair;
it is not a remote error. Authentication, billing/quota, unsupported settings,
context/output limits, cancellation and local/provenance faults are not remote
retries. An unclassified failure remains visible rather than guessed transient.

Retry waits start near 15 seconds and increase exponentially to 300 seconds,
with small jitter; a recorded valid `Retry-After` is a lower bound. There is no
fixed retry-count cutoff. Waiting makes no model call, remains cancellable, and
respects an explicit user deadline. Status reports `REMOTE_RETRY_WAIT` on the
affected task. `remote-retries.jsonl` preserves each reason, delay and original
failed turn; stage results record the policy and retry count. Original transport
faults and missing usage remain visible after recovery. A complete qualified
submission can proceed through actual mathematical gates; recovered execution
is never relabeled fault-free timing or a cold first-pass success.

For a run that already exited before this in-session recovery was available,
the invoking agent can continue explicitly selected interrupted NL0/Audit A work:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py resume /paper/rigorous-proof/OLD_RUN --detach
```

This prepares a new owned run, checks that the old processes exited, and binds
the exact original inputs/profiles, actual last remote failure and selected old
evidence. The old run is preserved. `--prepare-only` inspects this boundary before
`execute`. A definitive release-ready NL0 is restored byte-for-byte; only exact
qualified complete Audit A scopes are inherited. Incomplete reviews get fresh
isolated contexts without prior judgments. An interrupted unreleased author
uses its original declared inputs, including an own draft only if that draft
was already an explicit input. This is a disclosed warm continuation, not a
resurrected carrier or a new cold attempt. Previous usage stays in the old run.
This entry supports authoring/Audit A recovery only and rejects unknown faults,
live old owners, changed inputs, completed workflows or unsupported later phases.
A former explicit deadline cannot be reset: a finite-budget old run without a
retained absolute deadline is rejected. New stages then use the common carrier's
in-session remote retry throughout the remaining workflow.

## Observe, stop and clean

Scheduled owners use the compact, read-only observation command once per wake:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py observe /paper/rigorous-proof/RUN
```

This reports small metadata and exact process identities, without proof bodies
or new model/Lean calls. Full `status` remains available for located diagnosis.

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py status /paper/rigorous-proof/RUN
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cancel /paper/rigorous-proof/RUN
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cancel /paper/rigorous-proof/RUN --task T003
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cleanup /paper/rigorous-proof/RUN
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cleanup /paper/rigorous-proof/RUN --apply
```

Status writes coalesce to at most once per second, with a five-second liveness
heartbeat; both are program operations, not model calls. Usage updates on actual
provider reports, not every heartbeat. In-flight/missing usage remains unknown.
Cleanup previews by default, requires exact marked run roots, verifies process
PID/start identity/PGID and registered workspaces, and refuses deletion if exit
is unconfirmed. A selected-case stop/cleanup must not kill sibling cases or the
desktop application. Original problem files, installed skill and shared toolchain
are preserved. Cleanup can remove scientific results only when explicitly requested.

## Installation verification

Use `yui.py doctor` and `yui.py selftest`. Software tests and neutral controls are
inside this skill; no examples checkout, test/support directory, old results,
personal skills or chat memory are required. The current strong isolation backend
requires macOS sandbox-exec, an authenticated compatible Codex carrier, Python,
ripgrep and the pinned Lean/Mathlib environment. Missing prerequisites fail
explicitly; no unrestricted execution fallback is silently used. Selftests use
neutral fixtures and controlled executors, not a new mathematical benchmark.

At invocation and on actual source deferrals, display the [source qualification notice](conditional-sources.md). A conditional completion is not an ordinary PASS.
