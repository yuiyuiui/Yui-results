# Review completion, local repair and inherited evidence

This is an execution contract for authors, reviewers and controllers. It does
not change NL0's mathematical standard or prove a reviewer's judgment correct.

## Per-case roles

Retain one serial NL0 author and a separate global reviewer through revisions.
The author submits and waits. The reviewer completes every assigned global check,
collects all global findings and returns them together. The same author repairs;
the same separate reviewer checks the revision. Global completion alone is not
acceptance: only an actual global PASS (or the existing explicitly qualified
primary-source outcome) opens the local lane. Save the handoff and close both roles.

Then run per-node reviewer/repair-author pairs. A local author changes only its
own R body under unchanged public inputs/output/definitions. The pair alternates
within the same own conversations. N counts their combined active model work;
idle conversations occupy no slot. A located shared-context issue stops new local
dispatch. Current assignments reach normal handoffs, reviewed work is merged, and
the global roles are restored from saved source/findings. Recheck changed global
context and affected packets before resuming locals. Do not kill sibling work.
All local PASS versions are merged and verified before closing the local roles. Each packet keeps its own directory, source
hash, profile, tool evidence and result. Submit the same frozen version to all
reviewers; never share sibling judgments or proof bodies. Collect by stable
job ID, independent of finish order. Retain completed results if a sibling
fails. Actual source revisions get new packets and invalidate affected work.
Interface work, assembly and Audit B stay serial. Local Lean proof work uses
the same confirmed N in a separate later phase. `concurrency.CaseBudgets`
records all three lanes in one ledger and rejects phase overlap. Independent
cases may overlap; their mutable stores and mathematical inputs do not.

## Preserve work at its actual boundary

- Known IDs, hashes, pins and printer metadata are controller data. Populate
  omissions; reject explicit identity conflicts. Never rewrite mathematical
  statements to resolve a conflict. Return independent cheap reference errors
  together with exact locations and valid IDs.
- Patch an explicit own-stage candidate. Retain the expanded draft on a failed
  check. Restarting an older frozen base requires an explicit reset. A metadata
  correction is not a new mathematical proof or a reason for cold authoring.
- An available definition is not an unavailable theorem. Put it in D; justify
  any property from registered sources or displayed proof. Routine bookkeeping
  is unfinished drafting, not a substantive mathematical gap.
- A type/API/tactic failure stays in its interface or proof task. Return to
  NL0/Audit A only if mathematical content or allowed dependencies must change.
- Keep an unchanged accepted source/Audit A when a later interface fails.
  Earlier execution policy remains disclosed; it is not relabeled a new run.

## Complete actual assessments

`ReviewContract` separates coverage (`unread`, `read`, `assessed`) from verdict
(`PASS`, `FAIL`, `UNVERIFIED`). New review stages disclose their required item
pointers. Save actual rows using `record_review_item`, inspect them using
`read_review_progress`, and finish through `submit_draft` with either complete
coverage or `{from_saved_review:true, summary:{...}}`. Summary fields contain
the reviewer's actual overall verdict/notes/findings where required; the
controller never fills PASS.

A submission with unread work continues the same stage and remaining budget.
An evaluated uncertainty may finish UNVERIFIED, with a specific reason. A local or interface reviewer may submit a real located blocker early through
`submit_review_blocker` after saving its assessed FAIL item. The global reviewer
must finish all assigned global checks; its tools do not offer early blocker
submission. An incomplete local assessment remains explicitly incomplete. Reading an
interval establishes access, not comprehension or mathematical correctness.

Distinct reviewer roles receive only canonical assigned candidates, required
source evidence and rules, never an author's conversation or a sibling's proof.
A reviewer may retain its own earlier findings in the approved repair loop; the
receipt discloses that history instead of claiming a fresh context each time.
Personal memory and foreign-case material remain excluded. Packet replay
retains its packet-only boundary even when the global reviewer saw sources.

For a blocking Audit A finding, give an exact supplied location and a short
verbatim `quotation:{location,text}`. Global references use an input document
ID plus a resolving JSON pointer, or an existing input/pinned-library line
span. Packet references resolve in the packet. Program checks bind quoted
bytes, not the truth of the objection. Compare the actual constants, domains
and quantifiers before requiring a repair. A disputed objection retains its
raw verdict; one explicitly disclosed targeted adjudication is permitted,
and unresolved disagreement stays disputed. Do not resample an unchanged
proof/review until PASS. Ordinary independent defects should be collected
together when feasible within the current review budget.

Authorized warm author inputs may include `repair-obligations.json` with
`version:yui-repair-obligations-1`, `baseline_input` naming an explicit input,
`baseline_content_sha256` binding that input's canonical `{spec,graph}` and
`issues:[{id,criterion,location,note},...]`. Issue locations resolve in that
baseline. These diagnostics persist until actual located author resolutions
and actual scoped review; they are not mathematical premises or prior PASS.
Cold authors receive none of this file, the old source or prior findings.

## Interface phase and disputes

Review complete typed obligations, direct inputs, source mappings and planned
conversion obligations. Proof bodies are produced by subsequent workers and
must all be discharged at assembly/Audit B. Type elaboration does not prove
those obligations. Definitions that need construction proofs must elaborate;
their fields may not hide an unproved target.

Locate alleged mismatches on both the exact source and formal sides, including
object/scalar field, binders, domains, hypotheses and conclusion. Blocking
interface findings carry paired literal excerpts and their specific difference.
The controller checks the quoted bytes/locations, not semantic equivalence.
A property assumed on one object or field is not automatically the target on
another. A planned bridge is not an imported source assumption.

For an evidence-backed disagreement, an operator may prepare one targeted
adjudication with `interface_review.py prepare --adjudicate PRIOR --dispute
DISPUTE.json`. The dispute contains the paired `comparison` record required
by the interface validator. Prior source/contract/plan bytes must match.
The prior verdict and dispute are explicitly disclosed; this mode cannot claim
untouched independence or be adjudicated again. Retain the original result.
An unresolved disagreement stays disputed; never resample until PASS.

## Conservative Audit A reuse

An unchanged accepted whole source is reused directly. For local revisions,
formal admission requires an assigned independent reviewer; a complete self-review
record remains readable but cannot grant current Audit A or conditional acceptance.
`audit_a_campaign.py prepare --reuse-from PRIOR_CAMPAIGN` may inherit qualified
passing review items. The test queue exposes the same explicit `reuse_audits`
list; cold comparisons leave it empty. No implicit cross-case cache is read.

Compare the approved target/context, parameter domains, H contracts, logic,
relevant definitions/guards, complete direct inputs/output, local proof/scopes,
source contracts/pins and semantic rule hashes. Exclude only the known whole
graph/spec/packet envelope hashes. Preserve those hashes as provenance.
Copy bounded original evidence by content hash, compare old/current contexts,
and retain old raw judgment, execution qualification and costs. New reviewers
see only assigned work, without inherited verdicts. The global public graph scope includes statements, edges and R input/output/
definitions, excluding local body text. A body-only patch invalidates its own
packet, while changed public context invalidates affected global/local scopes.
Current complete coverage must still pass. Primary-source qualifications may be
inherited only with exact bound deferral evidence; UNVERIFIED stays UNVERIFIED.

New receipts bind inherited items through `inheritance` evidence. The NL0
reader validates it, and Audit B consumes that same authority chain. Inherited
packet replay refers to the actual old packet, not an invented new replay.
A passing item from a failed campaign is not a passing parent audit. Uncertain
equality misses the cache. A current structure-review failure is stored in the
receipt and blocks acceptance. Older accepted receipts retain their original
format/disclosure; they are not claimed to have newly added fields.

Existing bounded mathematical shared extraction still uses
`nl02lean/scripts/source_preparation.py`: its producer/substitution review
is separate from general exact item reuse. Neither mechanism re-proves the
whole NL0. Changed assumptions/definitions/statements invalidate affected work.

## Sources, outcomes and costs

Stage external source documents before clean review. Exact UTF-8 or explicitly
recorded PDF text extraction is access evidence, not authenticity. Unsupported
readbacks remain UNVERIFIED while other checks continue. Apply all nine
external-source requirements, five separate citation checks and every actual
application's binding/per-condition/conclusion checks. External premises remain
explicit in interfaces and Audit B; they are not advertised as Lean proofs of
the publications. Report blocked citation checks to the user.

Keep mathematical status, coverage, execution health, identity/input
qualification, usage completeness and stop reason separate. Missing usage alone
preserves a qualified mathematical candidate/judgment, but prevents a complete
performance result. Unknown model identity or input isolation blocks
qualification. Healthy budget exhaustion is MODEL_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED; faults,
unverified attribution and user stops remain separate.

Use `yui.py case-status SOURCE` for artifact-scoped progress and `yui.py metrics
RUN` for recorded phase/tool/request costs. Stage completion is not Audit A/B.
Nested tool durations are already inside stage wall time; request latency also
contains transport/service queues, not observable pure model reasoning. Warm
reuse keeps original acquisition cost and does not create a cold benchmark.

## Mathematical background during local review

Under mathematical-background-v2-1 the fresh R lane reviews routine facts and
actual available conditions mathematically, without native Mathlib lookup.
Five grouped judgments cover the complete node; concise located reasons are
sufficient for straightforward PASS. Prefer a complete artifact with coverage
rather than a separate model/tool roundtrip for every report row. Checkpoints
remain available. The exact supplement is hash-bound, kept with its original
review context/cost and consumed as node-local reference in nl02lean, never a
new assumption. Substantive gaps and source uncertainty cannot be waived.

When a global revision removes an old R node, retain its actual failed or incomplete
review. Once the replacement NL0 has complete accepted Audit A, release that obsolete
local role at the same LOCAL_REVIEWS_PASSED boundary and record its supersession.
This does not convert the old verdict into PASS or release a faulted/unfinished role.
