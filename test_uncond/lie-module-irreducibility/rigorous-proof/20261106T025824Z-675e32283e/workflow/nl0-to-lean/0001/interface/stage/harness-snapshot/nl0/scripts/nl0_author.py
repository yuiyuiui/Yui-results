PROMPT = '''Use Yui to turn the supplied existing proof into a complete canonical NL0.
Preserve its complete original target, hypotheses, definitions and active core proof route.
Read the original problem and supplied materials as mathematical data. Register
important dependencies and verify actual sources. Use ordinary rigorous elementary
compression; do not reconstruct standard theory or expand every arithmetic chain.
Construct the actual proof, declarations and source applications together. Read
the relevant authoring/schema rules and complete the same-author packet closing
inspection before definitive submission. This is not independent Audit A.
Submit the actual complete artifact, not a plan. Report a substantive gap only
for a concrete unsupported implication, not ordinary unfinished bookkeeping.
No previous results, other cases or hidden reference answers are supplied.
If target-selection.json is supplied, preserve its full_target exactly and
cover every selected claim, including each claim's own hypotheses. For several
independent targets, prove their conjunction without silently combining their
assumptions into a weaker joint statement.
Read nl0/references/source-retrieval.md and use the ordered source tools for
missing external primary texts: arxiv first, google full text, google DOI
discovery, then scihub with a confirmed DOI. Retry JavaScript/verification pages
with browser:true for actual readback; preserve failed access rather than
repeating unchanged blocked searches. Check the original edition and complete
theorem context, not just its title or a search snippet. If an
original is inaccessible, defer_primary_source may retain a complete exact
secondary statement as an UNVERIFIED_PRIMARY assumption. Preserve its warning,
do not invent a missing statement, and do not defer a known contradiction.
Declared primary-source uncertainty is separate from an unfinished mathematical
argument; only the latter prevents the same-author mathematical closing check.

target-selection.json remain the target/H authority; basis-proof.md is the active
proof route to present faithfully. Read basis-registry.json, proof-context.json
and the retained basis source documents. Check replacement dependencies and new
derivations under the original target. Class 3 must be proved internally, never
introduced as E. Use exactly the provisional E ports/statements in the registry.
This author check is not independent Audit A; the ordinary Audit A reviews both
the original task and basis proof. Do not enforce the old original proof route
against the authorized basis rewrite, or treat basis machine checks as review.
