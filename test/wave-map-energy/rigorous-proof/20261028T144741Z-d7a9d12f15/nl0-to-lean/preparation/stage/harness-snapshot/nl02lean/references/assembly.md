# Postprocessing: connect checked nodes into the source-facing Lean proof

Use one fresh **postprocessing author thread** after every required local proof
is checked. This is a serial stage per problem and consumes none of the N
parallel proof slots. The existing mapping author serves this role; its output
drives actual assembly. The **independent Audit B reviewer** is a subsequent
fresh thread. Assembly authoring, standalone compilation, kernel inspection
and semantic review have different completion states.

## Entry and immutable inputs

Require all planned proof bodies, exact interface/plan/source bindings and the
accepted NL0/Audit A authority. A missing producer or failed local job keeps
assembly blocked, even if all its consumers passed conditionally. Revalidate
the existing authority; do not rerun unchanged Audit A.

The author receives this problem's actual proof bundle, frozen contract/plan,
original H/E/M/N/P/D inventory, source-output map and own saved assembly
feedback. It may read its own checked proof bodies. Other cases, developer
history and hidden reference proofs remain unavailable. Do not preload all
background notes; retain their node-local reference locations.

## Connection rules

1. **Close the implementation DAG.** Use the frozen topological order and exact
   parameter/binder order. Supply each internal input with its actual checked
   producer; preserve implicit and instance arguments. Source-facing N outputs
   must use their recorded T realizations. Never replace a missing producer by
   an assumption, placeholder, opaque proof or changed target.
2. **Discharge retained M ports.** Supply a real Lean proof of each port in
   `library_terms`, preserving required H/E. Any proved result in the pinned
   Mathlib environment may be used; no matching source-M name, library signature
   copy or permission ledger is required. New interfaces should normally apply
   the library directly and omit unnecessary M ports. A declaration name alone
   cannot discharge an assumption.
3. **Export the original interface.** Retain all original H/E, parameters and
   definitions; remove M as assumptions by supplying the library proofs. Do
   not change representations, domains or hypotheses to force a match. The
   generator inspects the conditional theorem's actual universe parameters.
   Those occurring in retained parameters/H/E/conclusion are inferred from
   that interface. Only implementation-only levels absent from the retained
   interface are instantiated at zero at this application site; the general
   library declarations stay intact. Elaborate the generated assembled root
   synchronously (`set_option Elab.async false in`) so proof-only universe
   parameters are included at declaration commit. This does not serialize
   separate proof workers. Compile the
   result; do not guess that implicit inference succeeded.
4. **Build a standalone artifact.** `Proof.lean` contains definitions, actual
   local proofs, connected conditional root, checked library discharges and
   final `AuditBExport.P`. It is compiled before audit instrumentation is
   appended. `assembly.json` and `assembly-compiler.json` record that real
   complete-file outcome. A conditional fragment is not this gate.
5. **Prepare actual audit evidence.** After standalone assembly passes, inspect
   actual E/P kernel signatures and root closure. Carry short author
   correspondence notes for every E and complete P; relevant definitions and
   hidden fields remain visible to the independent reviewer. Save `Audit.lean`, `compiler.json`, `inspection.json`,
   correspondence, source/proof hashes and the review packet. Inspection has no
   default wall-clock or heartbeat budget. An explicitly requested cutoff or
   actual execution failure is an incomplete inspection, not a mathematical
   rejection. Full endpoint fidelity and kernel trust checks still apply.

## Repair and handoff

Use `check_draft` for actual feedback and keep the saved candidate. The result
identifies the candidate and failing layer; compiler errors precede long
printed types. `read_assembly_feedback` reads only this author's candidate,
generated Lean, full compiler output or mechanical records in bounded pages.
Follow pagination when a short excerpt is insufficient. Correct legitimate
mapping/library-application/connection errors without restarting proof authors.
For library applications or representation conversions, follow the same
[Lean implementation safeguards](lean-writing.md) used during local proof work.
Submitting the identical checked candidate reuses its exact hash-checked native
result; this does not create a semantic review or a new PASS.

An actual missing/changed interface or source premise returns to the affected
boundary. A generator/tool defect is execution engineering; report the concrete
diagnostic and preserve the draft if it is outside the author's allowed edits.
Do not report a source paper unavailable merely because a short log was cut,
or call an unlocated name-format rejection a mathematical gap. No routine
progress essay or periodic model continuation is required.

Hand off only after **standalone assembly and mechanical inspection pass**.
The independent reviewer then reads complete source/formal pairs and actual
evidence under [Audit B](audit-b.md). It receives no author's suggested verdict.
`ASSEMBLY-PASSED`, `AUDIT-B-MECHANICAL-PASSED` and a structurally accepted mapping
are distinct from the actual final Audit B PASS.
