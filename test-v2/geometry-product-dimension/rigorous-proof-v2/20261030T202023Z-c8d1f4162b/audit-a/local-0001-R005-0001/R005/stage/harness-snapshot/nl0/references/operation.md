# Installed skill operation

This reference is for the invoking agent/operator, not an additional proof step.
All executable paths are relative to the installed skill, independent of the
Yui repository. Keep case materials and outputs outside the installation.

## Request and configuration

The invoking agent identifies the explicit proof files and requested track:
`nl0` (NL0 + Audit A), `full`, `translate` (accepted NL0 onward), or `audit-b`
(existing native build, fresh semantic review only). Ask about genuinely ambiguous
scope; never add Lean work to an explicitly NL0-only request. Read only explicitly
provided files and relevant rules. A directory input selects its `problem.md`,
not all neighboring documents. Extra sources are explicit `--material` inputs.
Text/TeX/Markdown is copied exactly; PDF extraction uses `pdftotext -layout` or a disclosed pypdf fallback and
binds both original bytes and extracted text. An unreadable/scanned PDF needs an
explicitly checked text transcription before model execution.
The invoking agent checks that mathematical notation survives extraction before
freezing it as the supplied proof; a successful pdftotext exit is not a fidelity
judgment. Use an explicitly checked text source when the extraction is ambiguous.

Ask once for each missing active phase's model, reasoning effort and speed.
Retain choices supplied in the current request or already authorized in the
conversation. NL0 authors and Audit A share the NL0 profile. Source preparation,
local source review, interface authoring, all Lean proof jobs, assembly and Audit B
share the Lean profile. Do not ask about an unused phase. Do not invoke a separate
intent-classification model. Defaults in config.json require an explicit choice
(`--use-config-profiles`); installation defaults are not permission to bypass the
configuration question. The current isolated subscription carrier supports
Standard speed only. Unknown models/efforts/speeds are rejected explicitly;
model/effort availability is checked against local backend metadata and actual
transmitted/observed settings are recorded. No fallback or automatic upgrade.

Collect the following settings before preparing or dispatching a new run.
A phase profile means model, reasoning effort and speed:

| Requested track | Required user settings |
| --- | --- |
| NL0 and Audit A only (`nl0`) | NL0 phase profile and R-review worker count N |
| Accepted NL0/Audit A to Lean (`translate`) | Lean phase profile and per-case proof-worker count N |
| Complete workflow (`full`) | NL0 phase profile, Lean phase profile and per-case proof-worker count N |

Ask for all missing settings together. An explicitly supplied value, or an
explicit confirmation of a proposed value for this request, satisfies the
requirement; do not ask again. N must be a positive integer, including 1 when
the user wants serial proof work. Do not silently resolve an omitted count or
`auto` to two. If the user delegates the choice, propose a concrete N and obtain
confirmation before dispatch. Choosing `--use-config-profiles` does not choose
or confirm N. For several cases, explain that N applies to each case, then
retain a shared count unless different per-case settings were requested.

An `audit-b`-only continuation has no proof queue and needs only its Lean phase
profile, not N. `execute` and supported `resume` reuse an existing job's frozen
settings; they do not recollect values or change a historical worker count.
These configuration questions do not change the scheduling architecture:
Initial/global NL0 authors, global Audit A, preparation, assembly and final acceptance
remain serial. Local R reviewers and their repair authors share N active slots.
Later Lean proofs use N slots in their separate phase; waiting roles use no slot.

## Entry commands

The user need not type commands or prepare intermediate files. After [resolving the target](target-selection.md) and collecting
configuration, the invoking agent calls the installed entry. For example:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py run /papers/example/proof.md \
  --track full \
  --nl0-model gpt-6.1-sol --nl0-effort high --nl0-speed standard \
  --lean-model gpt-6-luna --lean-effort high --lean-speed standard \
  --max-concurrency 5 --target-file /papers/example/target-selection.json --detach
```

Supply several problem paths to run independent cases together. For different
per-case sources, materials or profiles, `prepare` each separately, then use
`execute RUN_A RUN_B`. `prepare` makes no model/Lean calls. `--detach` starts
owned background case processes and returns their exact run paths; a parent
chat Stop is not a verified cancellation of these processes.

The invoking owner then follows [foreground handoff](owner-observation.md):
register one host heartbeat every ten minutes, save its actual ID and end the
foreground turn. Detached dispatch returns an explicit pending monitoring
handoff; it does not itself register a schedule. Do not wait through repeated
foreground sleeps or status polls.

For translation pass `--track translate --source /accepted/nl0-case`, the Lean
profile and the confirmed `--max-concurrency N`. For audit-only pass
`--track audit-b --audit /checked/native-audit-dir`.
An audit-only continuation discloses inherited native evidence and does not
claim a new proof, compilation or cold workflow result.

The public `run`/`prepare` entry requires `--max-concurrency N` for NL0, full and
translation tracks. It limits local R reviews and local Lean proof jobs per case
in separate phases, not all model stages. Low-level controllers retain `auto` for compatibility with existing
jobs; this is not a substitute for user confirmation at the public entry.
`--case-concurrency K` separately limits independent cases;
by default the explicitly requested cases may run concurrently. The author, global review, preparation, assembly and Audit B
remain serial within each case. Python controllers occupy no model slot.
Backend/account limits may lower observed concurrency; retain actual outcomes.

## Local output ownership

Default permanent output is `<problem-directory>/rigorous-proof-v2/<run-id>/`:

```text
inputs/                  exact declared documents and extraction provenance
job.json                 immutable request, profiles, runtime/input bindings
runtime/                 owned allowlisted executable/rules/catalog snapshot
runtime-manifest.json    original-to-snapshot hashes, no credentials/memories
.yui-run.json            cleanup ownership marker
execution-status.json    coalesced status/usage/owned-process record
nl0/0001/                first author; later numbers are actual local repairs
audit-a/0001/            corresponding independent actual assessments
nl0-to-lean/preparation/  bounded shared-source decision and any local reviews
nl0-to-lean/0001/         interface, workflow/proof-run, optional assembly repair, optional audit-b-final
audit-b/                 final-review index, or audit-only continuation evidence
repairs/                 actual located diagnostic routing
logs/                    controller lifecycle output
case-result.json         actual acceptance scope and execution qualification
```

Only applicable stages are created. Multiple attempts are retained, not
silently overwritten. An explicit `--output` chooses another new directory;
it cannot overwrite an input or write inside the skill. Never create a global
repository results directory, scan parent folders for proof caches or read other
cases. OS temporary sandboxes are registered and retained until their specified successful role handoff or explicit user cancellation; they
are not persistent scientific output. Running several cases adds no files to
their common parent or the example root. Batch summaries are per-run metadata,
never worker-visible mathematical inputs.

Prepared jobs launch their queue/case scripts from the retained `runtime/`, not
the mutable installed checkout. Updates to the installation affect new jobs;
they do not rewrite active snapshot bindings. Keep runtime dependencies with
the evidence. Older jobs lacking snapshots retain their original validation.
Proof round diagnostics and selected retained rounds are documented in
[proof repair](../../nl02lean/references/proof-repair.md).

## Completion and repair

Ordinary `normal` policy organizes authoring, actual Audit A, optional bounded
factoring, interface freeze, the existing proof queue, actual standalone assembly,
native inspection and machine final acceptance against independently reviewed frozen semantics. It never turns a type/schema check
into a mathematical PASS. Unchanged valid Audit A is checked and reused rather
than repeated. A factoring no-op is normal. The existing narrow delta route
leaves consumers with accepted background notes unchanged; it never drops notes
or bypasses their scoped-review requirement to extract a lemma.

Follow the retained global/local roles in review-execution.md. Return complete
global findings to the same author before local dispatch; node-local repair uses
its own separate author. Inherit only exact qualified scopes. Restore global roles
for genuine public-context changes, draining active local work before repair.
A pre-freeze interface defect returns to the same preprocessing author/reviewer.
After freeze, E/P and their defining meanings cannot be rewritten by local or
connection authors; a genuine frozen-contract defect waits for the user. Native implementation feedback remains inside its current author/proof
stage. A revised target/hypothesis requires the source boundary, never a hidden
change to the accepted task. Supported mathematical obstacles, unresolved source
access/disagreement and execution faults remain visible. Retain the same assigned
author/reviewer through revisions; do not create fresh reviewers just to reroll a
verdict. Unchanged content or repeated evidence alone does not authorize a pause.
Execution has no imposed time,
token or call quota unless the user explicitly requests one.

Explicit `first-pass` policy stops on the first actual nonpass for measurement;
it is not the default user workflow. Developer reviewer calibration is separate
from a case's mathematical review. Calibration tests live in tests/tooling and
do not supply missing mathematical judgments or force every ordinary paper to
run a development exercise campaign first. Calibration status, when measured,
is reported separately; it is not fabricated as a prerequisite receipt.

## Recoverable controller faults

Normal policy repairs ordinary mathematical feedback in its assigned author or
proof stage; an Audit A/B nonpass is not by itself a first-pass stop. Classify
execution failures separately. A verified bookkeeping defect must not force
the proof and all completed independent reviews to be repeated.

Inherited evidence is checked before any remaining review model is called.
If a legacy path-to-key index is wrong but the original judgment and matching
source bytes are intact and hash-bound, collection reconstructs a new index,
validates it with the unchanged full checks, and proceeds. It records the old
and new bindings in bookkeeping-repairs.json. This operation changes no theorem,
judgment, source content or acceptance rule and makes no model/native calls.
Missing/tampered evidence, changed context, unqualified execution or a nonpassing
judgment cannot be repaired into a PASS by this route.

After repairing this known defect in an already stopped run, use
`yui.py resume OLD_RUN --repair-evidence --detach`. The guarded entry requires
the recorded index error to be reproducible and all required actual reviews
to be complete and qualified. It restores the unchanged released source through
its bound lineage and inherits completed scopes instead of asking models again.
An unknown program defect preserves the current phase/artifact checkpoint and
requires a verified software fix; it is not a mathematical rejection, permission
to rewrite proof rules, or a reason to replay the whole problem from scratch.

### Inherited probe-directory collisions

Library probes reserve a fresh numbered evidence directory atomically. Existing
normal directories, including inherited receipts and failed probes, are retained
and skipped. A new query returns its actual newly reserved receipt path and hash;
an occupied directory never supplies implicit source approval. Unsafe occupied
paths and unrelated I/O failures remain explicit execution faults, not failed
mathematical judgments. The stage log retains the failing tool and original
exception before cleanup, and the case result preserves that execution cause.

For an old run stopped by the former inherited-directory allocator defect, after
installing and verifying the software repair, an explicitly authorized owner can
prepare a guarded continuation:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py resume /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/OLD_RUN --repair-local-tool --prepare-only
```

This narrowly supports a normal-policy NL0 author-repair stage that stopped on
an actual `probe_library` directory collision before any new draft was submitted.
It verifies complete owned PID/start/PGID and group exits, the actual terminal
tool call, the unchanged inherited receipt, the released baseline, frozen input
manifest and exact located review obligations. Unknown faults, live groups,
changed evidence, a partial repair draft or changed configuration are rejected.
The new job starts at the located author-repair boundary; it does not replay
initial authoring, grant Audit A, revive the exited model thread or discard the
old run and costs. Changed contexts require fresh independent review under the
existing exact-scope reuse rules. Inspect the prepared job, then use `execute
NEW_RUN --detach` and the normal host-monitor handoff. The same guarded resume
can dispatch directly with `--detach` when prepare-only inspection is not needed.

## Remote-service recovery

The common model carrier retries positively identified temporary remote errors
(capacity, service availability, transient rate limiting or connection failures)
inside the same isolated thread. It retains actual drafts, source probes and
immutable tool receipts and uses the stage's existing short continuation input.
It does not repeat the initial task or execute a repeated completed tool-call ID
twice. The selected model, reasoning effort, speed, inputs and acceptance gates
remain fixed. A mathematical nonpass continues through normal located repair;
it is not a remote error. Authentication, billing/quota, unsupported settings,
context/output limits, cancellation and local/provenance faults are not remote
retries. An unclassified failure remains visible rather than guessed transient.

Retry waits are exactly 60seconds, with at most 30 retries after the original
failure. Carrier-level provider retries are disabled. Waiting requires no model
call and remains cancellable. Nonretryable faults, unknown/local bugs and retry
exhaustion enter `PAUSED_ERROR`, retaining the same processes, context, drafts
and temporary workspace. They notify the owner with the local `codex queue`
command and wait for explicit handling; they never imply task completion or
permission to clean up. Inspect with `yui.py errors RUN`; resume a supported live
checkpoint with `yui.py resume-error RUN --incident ID`; cancel with `yui.py cancel RUN`.
The [error lifecycle](error-lifecycle.md) specifies categories, owner routing,
full diagnostic logs, control guards and the only authorized exit boundaries.
Original faults, qualifications and missing usage remain visible after recovery.
A qualified submission still needs the unchanged mathematical acceptance gates;
resumed work is never relabeled a fault-free or cold first-pass success.

For a run that already exited before this in-session recovery was available,
the invoking agent can continue explicitly selected interrupted NL0/Audit A work:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py resume /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/OLD_RUN --detach
```

This prepares a new owned run, checks that the old processes exited, and binds
the exact original inputs/profiles, actual last remote failure and selected old
evidence. The old run is preserved. `--prepare-only` inspects this boundary before
`execute`. A definitive release-ready NL0 is restored byte-for-byte; only exact
qualified complete Audit A scopes are inherited. Incomplete reviews get fresh
isolated contexts without prior judgments. An interrupted unreleased author
uses its original declared inputs, including an own draft only if that draft
was already an explicit input. This is a disclosed warm continuation, not a
resurrected carrier or a new cold attempt. Previous usage stays in the old run.
This entry supports authoring/Audit A recovery only and rejects unknown faults,
live old owners, changed inputs, completed workflows or unsupported later phases.
A former explicit deadline cannot be reset: a finite-budget old run without a
retained absolute deadline is rejected. New stages then use the common carrier's
in-session remote retry throughout the remaining workflow.

### Explicit recovery after provider access is restored

HTTP 403 remains excluded from automatic retry and ordinary `resume`. After an
explicit human request to continue a stopped run, the owner may use the separate
manual route for an actual structured provider HTTP-connection 403:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/installed/skill/nl0/scripts/yui.py resume OLD_RUN \
  --after-access-restored --output NEW_RUN --prepare-only
python3 -B /path/to/installed/skill/nl0/scripts/yui.py execute NEW_RUN --detach
```

The first command requires the exact old processes/groups to have exited,
identity/input-qualified final denial evidence, matching recorded upstream HTTP
status, and no local/provenance, quota, configuration or unknown terminal cause.
It performs one authenticated model-catalog GET through the carrier's verified
TLS/system-proxy route and requires the selected model/effort to be advertised.
It makes no inference call, follows no redirects and logs no credential values
or catalog body. If access still fails, no continuation run is created. Actual
launch rechecks access before starting a model process. A successful metadata
check does not guarantee that a later inference request cannot fail again.

The owner must explicitly select this route; it never turns a 403 into a
transient error or grants an automatic retry loop. It supports only the same
NL0/Audit A recovery boundaries as ordinary service resume. A bound access
receipt, final fault/HTTP evidence, original inputs/target/profiles/workers and
any finite deadline remain validated. Static receipt validation stays offline;
future network outages cannot invalidate an old receipt's recorded observation.
`--output` must name a fresh directory outside the installation. When omitted,
the manual route creates a fresh sibling of OLD_RUN, preserving a custom output
parent. This flag is mutually exclusive with other repair modes.

Retain the original fault, all old partial usage and the exact previous runtime.
Report the new runtime and warm lineage separately. A definitive released source
can be restored under existing source/A inheritance rules. An unreleased author
re-enters from its original declared inputs: old drafts stay archived and are
not promoted into a released proof or silently fed to a fresh reviewer. This is
not resurrection of the destroyed native carrier context or a cold first pass.

## Observe, stop and clean

Scheduled owners use the compact, read-only observation command once per wake:

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py observe /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/RUN
```

This reports small metadata and exact process identities, without proof bodies
or new model/Lean calls. Full `status` remains available for located diagnosis.

```sh
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py status /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/RUN
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cancel /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/RUN
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cancel /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/RUN --task T003
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cleanup /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/RUN
python3 -B /path/to/Yui/nl0/scripts/yui.py cleanup /paper/rigorous-proof-v2/RUN --apply
```

Status writes coalesce to at most once per second, with a five-second liveness
heartbeat; both are program operations, not model calls. Usage updates on actual
provider reports, not every heartbeat. In-flight/missing usage remains unknown.
Cleanup previews by default, requires exact marked run roots, verifies process
PID/start identity/PGID and registered workspaces, and refuses deletion if exit
is unconfirmed. A selected-case stop/cleanup must not kill sibling cases or the
desktop application. Original problem files, installed skill and shared toolchain
are preserved. Cleanup can remove scientific results only when explicitly requested.

## Installation verification

Use `yui.py doctor` and `yui.py selftest`. Software tests and neutral controls are
inside this skill; no examples checkout, test/support directory, old results,
personal skills or chat memory are required. The current strong isolation backend
requires macOS sandbox-exec, an authenticated compatible Codex carrier, Python,
ripgrep and the pinned Lean/Mathlib environment. Missing prerequisites fail
explicitly; no unrestricted execution fallback is silently used. Selftests use
neutral fixtures and controlled executors, not a new mathematical benchmark.

At invocation and on actual source deferrals, display the [source qualification notice](conditional-sources.md). A conditional completion is not an ordinary PASS.

## Frozen proof recovery after a native-cleanup fault

After verified software repair and explicit user authorization, use
`yui.py resume OLD_RUN --repair-native-cleanup --prepare-only`, inspect the new
job, then execute it with `--detach` or omit `--prepare-only` for direct dispatch.
This route requires the old controller and all owned processes to have exited,
an actual `PROOF_UNFINISHED` result, an unchanged accepted source and frozen
interface, and only positively identified native-process cleanup faults among
the unfinished proof jobs. It refuses live work, changed profiles/worker counts,
mathematical nonpasses and unrelated execution failures.

The continuation skips NL0, Audit A and interface authoring. Previously checked
local bodies are candidates for fresh native rechecking, not a fabricated full
proof receipt. The stopped worker's own hash-bound drafts, including an
unaccepted helper interrupted during cleanup, may be restored only in the exact
same local packet. Record the fresh worker session and all old costs. Assembly,
native trust inspection and bound semantic authority remain required; their
normal located-repair boundaries are unchanged.
