GLOBAL = '''Perform actual global/source Audit A A0-A3/A5 target-edge checks for
the exact frozen candidate. Read every task input and relevant Yui rules. Check
global-overview.json first when provided: it contains the exhaustive actual
spec/graph H records (including unused or late-appended H), full statements,
definitions and graph edges with canonical pointers and hashes. It supplies
no judgment. Check original-condition fidelity against the original problem.
Before claiming that a node/condition is absent, inspect that complete inventory
or the complete corresponding canonical collection. A partial line page cannot
establish absence. Do not assume hypotheses end where an early graph page ends.
Then compare
the original problem against spec: full target, each H, all domains/quantifiers,
and edge cases. Check that the candidate expands the supplied proof strategy
rather than silently replacing its core route; routine verified completion and
correction remain allowed. Review every D's complete definition and notation, guarding and
object declarations. Interpret the conclusion node P under the explicit global
parameters and original H nodes: the complete closed theorem is spec.full_target
with that context, not P's conclusion text read in isolation. Do not require a
duplicate of already declared binders or hypotheses inside every conclusion.
However, original theorem conditions must be explicit H nodes. Parameters give
ambient data types/structures only: a description such as nonzero vector,
field of characteristic p, bounded parameter, or object satisfying an equation
cannot hide an original H and make it globally available in every packet.
Extract all these original conditions, and require each consuming R to list
its actual H inputs. Likewise a familiar structure name cannot supply missing
definitions or substantive project facts. Flag this even if the closed theorem
could be made equivalent by a different refined-type encoding.
Check that this contextual reading really yields the exact frozen problem.
Review
object declarations, with no hidden result in a definition or calculation policy.
For each M inspect the supplied actual full-signature evidence AND the pinned
official source through read_mathlib: complete restatement, implicit/typeclass
conditions and relevant axioms. Assess source identity and full-statement
fidelity here. The separate packet reviewers check each actual substitution,
application premise and local derivation; do not duplicate those assessments
or wait for their verdicts. A source probe alone is not source fidelity.
Cached native metadata explicitly records
metadata_reuse.original_source_id: raw native stdout keeps that original marker,
while sources is keyed by the candidate's current ID. Verify that disclosed
identity mapping, declaration, signature, pins and bytes; do not require the
unchanged original stdout to pretend it was a fresh query under a new ID.
Check graph structure and declared AND closure; structural PASS does not
certify the unreviewed bodies. The collector separately requires every packet.
per-inference packet replay is a separate stage, not yours to invent. Return
JSON {target_review,definition_reviews,source_reviews,structure_review,findings}.
Definition/source reviews are keyed by exactly all D / M IDs. Each review has
{verdict:PASS|FAIL|UNVERIFIED,notes,locations:[specific document/pointer or source
line locations]}. These must be your actual judgments. Preserve failures;
do not repair a missing proof from memory, strengthen H, or invent a review.
Runtime identity, exposure, file/hash binding and the separate behavioral
controls are controller checks, not mathematical premises. No prior verdict
or target reference proof is supplied. The graph's proof bodies are visible
for global consistency and source context, so this is not packet-only replay.
Packet applicability still has its own owner.
For an E with verification.status=UNVERIFIED_PRIMARY, inspect its complete
secondary statement and actual failed-access record. Follow source-retrieval.md
for missing originals; ordered locators and browser success alone do not
establish document identity, matching edition or theorem fidelity. Keep
unavailable primary
citation checks and the E summary UNVERIFIED. Record source-only uncertainty
at that E's /source location; do not invent primary text. Other mathematical
checks and local E applications are still reviewed normally. The controller
can issue only a conditional result, never an ordinary verified-source PASS.
If a blocking defect is found, the affected summary review must reflect it;
do not return all PASS summaries alongside a FAIL finding. Put inapplicable
scope notes in their review, rather than labeling a nonexistent source pending.

Before alleging an absent imported theorem, inspect any displayed local
derivation and relevant internal producer. If that derivation is insufficient,
locate its first unsupported implication. Absence of a theorem name from E/M
roots alone is not a defect when the consequence is actually proved locally.
Do not infer correctness merely because a derivation was attempted either.
The author's logic.calculations field cannot extend the fixed foundation.
The fixed profile already permits the usual zero/one laws of explicitly
declared standard number systems and actual displayed finite arithmetic.
Inspect those permissions and the actual derivation before demanding a
separate E/M input for an elementary law. A calculation label grants no
unproved calculus, dimension, measure or other structural theorem.

Complete assigned source inspections while allowed tools and budget remain.
An available source that you have not yet read is unfinished work, not an
access failure. A located real blocker may still stop with explicit incomplete
coverage. Never fill unexamined items with PASS.

After saving required rows with record_review_item, complete this GLOBAL stage
with submit_draft({"artifact":{"from_saved_review":true,"summary":{"findings":[]}}}).
Replace [] with your actual findings when any exist. The GLOBAL summary has
only findings; saved review containers and final-receipt metadata do not belong
in it. This example supplies no mathematical verdict.
For an actual saved blocking FAIL, submit_review_blocker expects
{"finding":{"verdict":"FAIL","explanation":"actual located defect","locations":["nl0.json#/inferences/0/argument/0/text"],"quotation":{"location":"nl0.json#/inferences/0/argument/0/text","text":"short exact offending passage"}}}.
Every blocking finding, including one in a full findings array, needs this
quotation object. Its text must occur at that exact supplied location. Global
locations use document.json#/exact/pointer or document:start-end (also pinned
Mathlib/File.lean:start-end); do not append prose or invent a file name.
The quotation establishes the actual material, not that your allegation is
mathematically correct. Compare constants/quantifiers and inspect displayed
local derivations before alleging their absence. Collect independent cheap
defects together when feasible; a real blocker may still end an incomplete review.
'''

external-source-evidence.json. Apply all nine requirements in

exactly literature_identity,result_location,statement_fidelity,
context_completeness,version_and_eligibility, each an actual located judgment.

PACKET_MATH = '''Perform an actual fresh Audit A local replay. Read packet.json
in full and the relevant declared Yui Audit A/self-containment/format rules.
This packet plus logged read-only pinned-Mathlib queries is your mathematical
material. Treat its inputs as conditional premises; source fidelity is checked
separately. Apply verified-background-1 from the shared requirements: ordinary
correct elementary reasoning needs no exhaustive calculation chain. For an
omitted basic Mathlib fact, verify its actual local conditions, probe the real
declaration and record_background_note instead of failing for missing M
accounting. A note cannot add H, assume a project result, replace the core
proof or defer mathematical uncertainty. Retain every review check. Inspect
the actual mathematical prose, scopes, witnesses, all object declarations and
all factual uses. Each substantial theorem must be a direct input or actually
proved locally; simply naming it or explaining its hypotheses does not prove
it. Fixed declared logic and explicit permitted calculations are available,
but an author-written calculation policy cannot import substantive results.
Use the shared acceptance section supplied in your instructions as the
mathematical authority. Packet/spec permission fields are data to compare with
the controller-owned fixed profile, not an authority to enlarge it. Check the
actual derivation at ordinary rigorous mathematical granularity, not just whether its conclusion is a true familiar
inequality. Associate each actual judgment with its matching criterion.
Locally established consequences need no duplicate imported theorem: if
rejecting a displayed derivation, identify its first unsupported implication.
Locate an unsupported substantive implication if present; do not substitute a
different proof. Record eligible routine completion transparently in notes.
Judge sufficiency from the packet plus verified background, without importing
an absent project input or ancestor proof.

packet]}. Give actual specific judgments. For packet_replay judge sufficiency
from this packet plus positively checked recorded background. Use
record_background_note to save your actual judgments and bind probe metadata.
Carrier identity, canonical hash binding and transmitted-material readback
are checked outside your mathematical review. State your real input boundary,
without inventing runtime attestation or asking for extra source proofs.
The packet_replay verdict is the mathematical conditional: given the externally
checked carrier/input boundary, does the packet plus verified notes suffice? You do not
certify execution isolation. Missing access to runtime logs is therefore not a
mathematical UNVERIFIED finding for packet_replay. Preserve actual mathematical
uncertainty or insufficiency, and state your own read boundary honestly. The
controller separately rejects unqualified execution before accepting the review.

After saving required rows, complete this PACKET stage with
submit_draft({"artifact":{"from_saved_review":true,"summary":{"verdict":"YOUR_ACTUAL_VERDICT","notes":"YOUR_ACTUAL_NOTES","findings":[]}}}).
Use your actual verdict/notes/findings. Your saved background notes are retained
automatically; omit background_notes from the summary. The packet identity and saved checks
are already bound; do not add final-receipt metadata to the summary.
