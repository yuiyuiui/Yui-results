# Single-case execution and file-based control

This reference is for the run operator and Python controller. A proof worker
uses its frozen packet, not execution/control files or sibling proofs. Recording
and cancellation make no model requests and add no mathematical input.

Use the [canonical worker names](../../nl0/references/terminology.md#canonical-worker-names):
preprocessing worker, formalization workers (N slots), and postprocessing worker.
These group responsibilities across the translation stage. Each may use several
separate threads or program actions; a queue slot is not a persistent model
conversation. The upstream NL0 worker covers NL0 authoring and Audit A.

## Scope and queue

Keep concurrent cases separate from `max_concurrency=auto|N` inside one case.
The batch starts explicitly requested independent Python case owners, each with its
own serial preparation/global-review budget, R-review budget, proof budget, output and mutable state. Three cases with N=2
can overlap six proof workers. Python coordinators consume no model slot.
Unknown CLI limits use the disclosed fallback two, not a claimed maximum.
Share immutable rules/toolchains, not cross-case prompts, drafts or proof stores.
Within each case, NL0 authoring, global Audit A, interface work and Audit B
are serial. Frozen local R reviews use the confirmed N concurrently, followed
later by up to N local Lean proofs. These phases cannot overlap in one case. All roles share one usage ledger.

1. Retain source/Audit A and interface/plan freeze checks. All types must
   elaborate before model dispatch. Changes need a new accepted revision/run.
2. Materialize jobs in deterministic topological order. One node is one job;
   exact compatible shared-job groups have one producer and recorded consumers.
   Record IDs, direct inputs, hashes, attempts and result locations.
3. The existing executor queue supplies at most N slots. A free slot immediately
   takes another pending job. Distinguish slot ID from model session/attempt ID.
4. Each new node owns a separate model conversation; revisions reuse that
   node's conversation, while a free slot may serve a different node. Supply only its target, direct inputs, definitions/views,
   NL argument and allowed tools. Conditional consumers may run before producer
   bodies finish; assembly must later discharge the actual dependencies.
5. Recheck returned proofs with Lean. Existing store locks serialize admission.
   Do not overwrite accepted results with late attempts. Preserve rejected code.
6. Ordinary unfinished work permits other queued conditional jobs to finish,
   but leaves the root incomplete. Continue local implementation work without a
   fixed time/token quota; do not silently restart failed experiments or escalate models. Source/interface changes return to
   their gate; a tactic failure does not automatically require rewriting NL0.
7. Assemble actual bodies, discharge every internal input, run fresh Lean and
   complete existing Audit B. Execution records never grant mathematical PASS.

Batch completion requires actual terminal case outcomes. A retained pause or
retry wait is nonterminal, including when the foreground chat has ended. Errors
do not authorize exit/cleanup. Reject duplicate active case IDs and existing
output ownership. User cancellation remains an explicit terminal outcome. No adaptive priority or expensive scheduling model is used.

Omitted or null `time_budget_seconds` means unlimited whole-case execution.
Configuration also leaves stage time limits and the total token budget null. The
runtime does not cap model-call count or stop a healthy task because tool-result
idle time exceeded a threshold. Each native Lean call has a separate 300-second
wall limit from `config.json` (`timeouts.native_seconds`), uses Lean's finite
default heartbeat budget and has no artificial per-process heap quota. A shorter
explicit caller or remaining case/stage deadline takes precedence. A native
timeout terminates and reaps the owned process, retains the candidate and actual
diagnostic, and returns exit code 124 with `error_kind: LEAN_TIMEOUT` to the same
worker. It does not cancel that worker or the case, accept the candidate, or
establish a mathematical failure. In Yui proof workers, that result and actual
heartbeat-exhaustion results automatically include frozen ST020 `repair_advice`.
The original worker first follows the applicable diagnostic branch, isolates
and repairs the expensive application, then checks the unchanged target again.
This requires no extra model call and is independent of optional free-form bank
queries. Card hashes/revision and unavailable-advice reasons are retained with
the original failed result. Explicit cancellation and actual execution failures
retain their stop rules; ordinary candidate rejection permits local repair.

Proof workers may submit `report_proof_obstruction` with located own evidence.
Other healthy/queued nodes keep their work. After active handoffs, serial global
connection repair may change internal bodies and connections, never frozen E/P
or meaning-determining definitions. Located frozen-contract/source defects wait
for the user. No fixed idle-turn threshold retires a round or cancels siblings.
See [repair routing](proof-repair.md) for the allowed transitions.

Only an explicit user request may enable a positive case deadline for a separate
bounded experiment. It starts with the case process and covers preparation,
model-slot waiting, proofs, assembly and Audit B without resetting at each
stage. Preserve outputs on expiry and distinguish it from external cancellation.
Transport handshakes, dead sockets, cleanup/reaping waits, and polling intervals
are operational controls, not allowances for mathematical work.

## One execution record

Read `<problem-directory>/rigorous-proof/<run-id>/execution-status.json` for
normal installed runs. Each translation attempt has a `workflow/` child under
`nl0-to-lean/<attempt>/` for its frozen artifacts.
Standalone `workflow.py run` records at its workflow root; `run_graph.py` records
at its own output. One thread-safe recorder writes pretty UTF-8 JSON atomically.
Volatile state is outside frozen inputs. Existing transcripts remain evidence;
native check results are under `native-checks/`.

Fields include case/run IDs and bindings; controller identity/phase; model and
concurrency; counts; task slot/attempt IDs, direct inputs, timings and activity;
actual latest Lean checks and log paths; owned processes; usage; cancellation;
and result/health qualifications. `LOCAL_CHECKED` is not Audit B. `FINISHED` for
a text/review stage is only stage completion. Waiting for a model slot differs
from actual `MODEL_RUNNING` or `LEAN_CHECKING` activity.
Each proof task separately reports distinct action/check counts, completed idle
turns and last real progress/check timestamps. These are not transport liveness
or an assertion of mathematical advancement. Later successful rounds are chosen
by hash-bound `proof-selection.json`; assembly/Audit B use that retained round.
`concurrency.roles` separates serial preparation/global-review, local R-review
and proof peaks; `proof_counts`
counts only actual proof tasks. A total model-stage peak is not proof utilization.

- Events update memory; ordinary writes coalesce to at most once per second,
  with an intended healthy-host latency of about a second. Continuous events
  cannot postpone that flush indefinitely.
- A five-second heartbeat indicates controller liveness. Stop requests,
  finalization and cleanup confirmation force immediate writes.
- Each Lean check has an ID, code hash and log. Its active `CHECKING` record is
  separate from the previous completed result. Update when the compiler returns.
- Usage changes only on valid provider reports, deduplicated by response ID.
  In-flight/unreported use is unknown; exact per-token live counting is not
  promised. `usage_last_observed_at_utc` differs from heartbeat/file timestamps.
  Cached/reasoning are subsets, not extra tokens. Missing usage is never zero.
- Do not scan full transcripts on every refresh. Final stage ledgers reconcile
  counters after response logging drains; incomplete reports stay PARTIAL/UNKNOWN.

A file is a snapshot, not proof its writer lives. `workflow.py status` also
checks process identity. Missing owner/stale heartbeat means unknown cleanup.
`controller.state=FINALIZED` means recording ended, not that the host Python
process vanished. Child `EXITED` requires actual process reaping.

## Stop and retained results

```sh
python3 nl02lean/scripts/workflow.py status /absolute/translation-output
python3 nl02lean/scripts/workflow.py cancel /absolute/translation-output
python3 nl02lean/scripts/workflow.py cancel /absolute/translation-output --task T003
```

Cancel writes an idempotent scoped request under `control/`, without editing
mathematical inputs. For one or several complete cases use
`python3 nl0/scripts/yui.py cancel /absolute/run-a /absolute/run-b`.

Stop affected pending claims; cancel waiting slot acquisitions without starting
a model. Interrupt the exact active model turn, wait boundedly for its event,
stop/reap registered CLI/Lean processes and retain evidence. SIGINT/SIGTERM use
the same cleanup. Match PID and process-start identity before escalation; never
use broad pkill. Separate external cancellation from model budget exhaustion,
execution faults and mathematical gaps. Unconfirmed cleanup remains UNKNOWN.

**The desktop main-chat Stop button is not wired to these independent CLI
sessions.** Supported control is the explicit file/CLI path and handled process
signals, not unverified UI propagation. Hard kill may prevent cleanup: inspect
stale ownership/residuals rather than assuming every child stopped.

Preserve attempts and reports. Explicit new runs may use the existing compatible
checked-proof store, re-elaborated by Lean with acquisition cost and warm reuse
disclosed. General node resume, model-session resurrection and automatic NL0/B
recovery are not implemented. An active/uncertain owner blocks output reuse.
