# Explicit continuation with unverified primary sources

Try the actual source before deferring it. Follow [ordered retrieval](source-retrieval.md):
arXiv first, Google full text, Google DOI discovery, then Sci-Hub with a confirmed
DOI. The author and global reviewer have `search_external_sources` with an
explicit engine and `read_external_source` with optional `browser=true`.
The controller preserves
actual access records and document/text hashes. A search result, HTTP success
or readable abstract alone is not theorem verification. Browser-only pages,
unresolved challenges, paywalls and access failures are recorded.
The invoking agent may use its ordinary source tools or ask for human access
when needed, while keeping every supplied document explicit and hash-bound.
The reader returns case-relative `evidence` and `primary_evidence_candidates`
for downloaded bytes and extracted text. These are readable-source candidates,
not a judgment of authenticity: only designate the actual original source as
primary, and retain the access record alongside it. PDF staging uses pdftotext
when available, otherwise pypdf; neither extraction establishes theorem fidelity.

For JavaScript or verification pages, retry the source tool with `browser=true`.
Its trusted helper uses a fresh local Chrome context and ordinary site controls,
including the site's own ALTCHA button, without personal cookies or a paid
service. Unsupported challenges stay `HUMAN_ACCESS_REQUIRED`; missing browser
tools and browser errors remain recorded failures. The invoking agent may use
an actual built-in-browser control tool before dispatch; merely opening or
queuing a tab is not evidence that results or a paper were read. A downloaded
paper can be an explicit source input before dispatch, or part of a new reviewed
source revision. Never change an active run's frozen input files to insert a
browser result. The isolated CLI stages do not control the user's desktop tabs.

If the primary text remains unavailable, continue only from a complete external
statement actually present in a supplied secondary source. Call
`defer_primary_source` with its E ID, exact statement/quotation, input ID and
own failed access-record paths. No missing theorem may be invented from model
memory. Known contradictions remain failures, not access deferrals.

The tool returns `verification: {status: UNVERIFIED_PRIMARY, record: {path,
sha256}}`. Put it in `E.source`, use empty `primary_evidence`, and retain the
normal author/title/version/locator/context fields with honest uncertainty.
The author contract binds the supporting secondary text and access records.
The statement must preserve the quotation. This is an explicit assumption for
conditional work; neither a familiar name nor a lookup failure proves it.

## Review and continuation boundaries

Global Audit A keeps the E review and unavailable primary citation checks
`UNVERIFIED`. It must still examine whether the explicit secondary statement is
complete and whether its declared role is legitimate. Every other mathematical
check, every local R check and every external application must actually PASS.
Source-only findings may be UNVERIFIED at that E's source location. A FAIL,
an unassessed item, unrelated uncertainty or an incomplete statement prevents
conditional continuation. A deferred source can never receive a verified PASS
until its source record is replaced and the affected checks are actually done.

The machine result has `current_standard_receipt_valid: false` and, only when
these conditions hold, `current_conditional_receipt_valid: true`. The ordinary
receipt and every unresolved judgment stay intact. The same exact source/A
is used in translation; optional source factoring is skipped for this route.
Local Lean proofs, assembly and native trust checks still have to complete.
Audit B compares Lean external premises with the explicit frozen E statements
and checks the entire target. It does not reclassify the unverified publication
claims as verified. Upstream source uncertainty remains attached to the result.

Final states are `DRAFT-AUDIT-CONDITIONAL`, `AUDIT-B-CONDITIONAL`, or
`WORKFLOW-CONDITIONAL`. They are distinct from ordinary PASS. The execution may
finish normally, but `acceptance_target_satisfied` remains false and source
follow-up remains required. Other failed mathematics cannot use this route.

## User notification

At invocation, explain that inaccessible primary sources can lead to a
conditional result, not full source verification. When an actual source is
deferred, display its warning and the remaining check in progress/status.
Do not wait for the user to discover an internal JSON file.

The source and final run retain `warn.json` and `warn.md`: original target and
source hashes, E IDs, exact assumed statements, actual retrieval-record links,
and the meaning of the remaining uncertainty. Include these files and a plain
language qualification in the final response. A Lean build does not remove
these warnings. New verification requires actual primary readback and fresh
affected review, never a manual change from UNVERIFIED to PASS.
